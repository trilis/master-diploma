  abstract = {To achieve trust and continuity in the smart contracts-based business process execution, the verification of such smart contracts is mandatory. A blockchain-based smart contract should work as intended before using it. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain, any bugs or errors will become permanent once published and could lead to huge economic losses. To avoid such problems, verification is required to check the correctness and the security of the smart contract. In this survey, we consider the smart contracts and we investigate smart contacts formal verification methods. We also investigate the security assurance for smart contracts using vulnerabilities detection methods. In this context, we provide a detailed overview of the different approaches to verify the smart contracts and we present the used methods and tools. We show a description of each method as well as its advantages and limitations and we draw several conclusions.}
